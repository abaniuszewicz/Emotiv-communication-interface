# Algorithms of mental commands in brain-computer interfaces

Master thesis on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at West Pomeranian University of Technology Szczecin, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

## Purpose and scope

My main goal was to develop virtual keyboard system (a keyboard that does not need physical interaction to provide its input) controlled with use of brain-activity acquisition device. 

In my thesis I've covered:
* *theoretical* introduction to brain-computer interfaces: what are BCIs, basics of signal acquisition and processing, example applications,
* research on commercially available brain-activity recording devices: Emotiv Insight & EPOC+, Muse/Muse 2, MindWave Mobile 2, OpenBCI,
* implementation of my virtual keyboard: hardware and software selection, structure of my solution, algorithms, training of mental commands,
* system tests: how amount of mental commands, amount of their training session and parameters of my algorithms affect detection correctness.

## Technologies

In my thesis I've used:

* C#
* WPF
* [CortexAPI](https://github.com/Emotiv/cortex-v2-example): WebSocket, JSON
* LaTeX
