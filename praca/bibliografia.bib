For these applications users have other demands, and they will be critical about devices that limit physical movements and that require long periods of training. Prototype BCI applications now appear in the domain of games and entertainment that aim at adapting and controlling a game using brain signals in addition to traditional physical and mental abilities.},

abstract= {Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is a steadily growing area of
research.  While initially BCI research was focused on applications
for paralyzed patients, increasingly more alternative applications in
healthy human subjects are proposed and investigated. In particular,
monitoring of mental states and decoding of covert user states have
seen a strong rise of interest.  Here, we present some examples of
such novel applications which provide evidence for the promising
potential of BCI technology for non-medical uses.  Furthermore, we
discuss distinct methodological improvements required to bring
non-medical applications of BCI technology to a diversity of layperson
target groups, e.g., ease of use, minimal training, general usability,
short control latencies.}

    abstract = {A P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) enables a wide range of people to control devices that improve their quality of life. Ensemble classifiers with naive partitioning were recently applied to the P300-based BCI and these classification performances were assessed. However, they were usually trained on a large amount of training data (e.g., 15300). In this study, we evaluated ensemble linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers with a newly proposed overlapped partitioning method using 900 training data. In addition, the classification performances of the ensemble classifier with naive partitioning and a single LDA classifier were compared. One of three conditions for dimension reduction was applied: the stepwise method, principal component analysis (PCA), or none. The results show that an ensemble stepwise LDA (SWLDA) classifier with overlapped partitioning achieved a better performance than the commonly used single SWLDA classifier and an ensemble SWLDA classifier with naive partitioning. This result implies that the performance of the SWLDA is improved by overlapped partitioning and the ensemble classifier with overlapped partitioning requires less training data than that with naive partitioning. This study contributes towards reducing the required amount of training data and achieving better classification performance.},
